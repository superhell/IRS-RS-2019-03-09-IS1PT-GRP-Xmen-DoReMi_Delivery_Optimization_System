A delivery routing optimization system is introduced for DoReMi Books Inc. DoReMi Books Inc. is a company started in 1955 and specialize in the supply and sale of classical music scores and music books in the USA with subsidiaries in the major cities of each of the 50 states. In the previous project, our team focused on the automated system for the online music books sale transaction and order handling process as well as introduce improved stock and inventory planning and management capabilities. To further improve the intelligent business process capability, a delivery routing optimization system is necessary because it not only improve the efficiency of delivery process but also directly related to the satisfaction of customer experience.

As a traditional company, DoReMi Books Inc. is encountering changelings from its competitors who have brought on by online sales transactions. In comparison, some of its business processes are still manual and rather traditional. In response to the new challenges, the company decided to conduct a business process improvement exercise to implement intelligent planning and process optimization capabilities. 

Our group of five members, brainstormed and decided to build a reasoning system which need conduct search and optimization to get optimal (sub-optimal) solutions. The system we’re focusing in this group project is a delivery routing optimization system with hybrid optimization techniques (Clustering, GA and Machine learning) and automate. To be realistic, we use the real cities in one state (Iowa) in United States. 

Our primary objective is to apply the search and optimization techniques in DoReMi’s delivery routing system. It will significantly improve the delivery efficiency by saving the cost and time, enhance customer satisfaction, and thus competence. Eventually will benefit for the companies in the same industry area.
